Introduction
============
Crazy Eddie's GUI System uses a variety of xml data files for it's various
resources, possibly one of the most important of these is the Imageset.

The Imageset essentially takes a source image file, and defines regions of
that file as named 'Images' which the core CEGUI library can then draw to the
display.  Since editing these xml files by hand is no fun at all, and can take
a large amount of time, we have this nice little tool for editing them
interactively.
